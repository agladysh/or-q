# TODO: This test will fail when tests are run outside the checked-out codebase
# as it depends on the actual file path existing in the filesystem

tests:
  - name: smoke
    argv: echo packages/plugin-filesystem/assets/tests/commands/file.yaml file
    stdin: ''
    stdout:
      - contains: 'suite: file'
