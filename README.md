# OR-Q: OpenRouter Query Porcelain Tool with Plugins

README TBD, read the code.

KISS, YAGNI, DRY, CS.

Some implementation conventions (non-exhaustive):

- Ingest as YAML, output JSON.
- Do not pretty-print JSON, but append trailing newline

If you find a violation of the convention above, fix it.

Plugin layout conventions: see `@or-q/plugin-test`
